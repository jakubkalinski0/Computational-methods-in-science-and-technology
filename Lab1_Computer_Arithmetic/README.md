
## Requirements

*   **C Compiler:** A C compiler supporting the C11 standard (e.g., GCC).
*   **Make:** The `make` build automation tool.
*   **Gnuplot:** The Gnuplot utility for generating plots from the scripts.

## Building and Running

The project uses a Makefile for easy management. Open your terminal in the project's root directory.

1.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    make all
    # or simply:
    make
    ```
    This compiles the source code and creates the executable `bin/computer_arithmetic`.

2.  **Run the C program (Generate Data & Scripts):**
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    This will first compile the code (if needed) and then execute the C program. The Makefile automatically provides the necessary directory paths (`data`, `scripts`, `plots`) to the executable. This step generates:
    *   CSV data files in the `data/` directory.
    *   Gnuplot `.gp` script files in the `scripts/` directory.

3.  **Generate Plots:**
    ```bash
    make plots
    ```
    This performs the `make run` steps (compiling and running the C code to generate data/scripts) and *then* automatically executes all the generated Gnuplot scripts (`*.gp`) found in the `scripts/` directory. This step generates:
    *   PNG plot images in the `plots/` directory.

## Output Files

After running `make plots`, you will find the following generated files:

*   **`data/` Directory:**
    *   `results.csv`: Combined results for all functions and precisions in a wide format.
    *   `separate_results_f[1-4].csv`: Individual results for each function (columns: x, float, double, long_double).
    *   `separate_results_error_analysis.csv`: Relative errors of `float` and `double` results compared to `long double`.
*   **`scripts/` Directory:**
    *   Multiple `.gp` files. These are Gnuplot scripts configured to read data from `data/` and generate plots in `plots/`.
*   **`plots/` Directory:**
    *   Multiple `.png` files. These are the graphical plots visualizing the results and errors, generated by Gnuplot via the `make plots` command. Examine these plots to understand the numerical behavior.

## Analysis and Interpretation

A detailed analysis of the results, explaining the observed differences due to floating-point precision, calculation methods, and numerical stability issues (like subtractive cancellation), can be found in the accompanying report file:

**`Report_Lab1_Computer_Arithmetic.pdf`**

Please note that the analysis within that document is written in **Polish**.

## Cleanup

*   **Remove generated files (but keep directories):**
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
    This removes object files (`*.o`), the executable, CSV files (`*.csv`), Gnuplot scripts (`*.gp`), and plot images (`*.png`).

*   **Remove generated files AND directories:**
    ```bash
    make distclean
    ```
    This does everything `make clean` does and also removes the `obj/`, `bin/`, `data/`, `scripts/`, and `plots/` directories.
